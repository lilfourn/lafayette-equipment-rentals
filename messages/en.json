        },
        {
          "question": "What makes renting on Lafayette different?",
          "answer": "Unlike traditional rental houses, Lafayette acts as your equipment broker. We shop the market for you, comparing prices and availability from multiple rental companies simultaneously. This gives you more options, better prices, and saves you time from calling around to different rental companies."
        },
        {
          "question": "What equipment is available on Lafayette?",
          "answer": "We offer a comprehensive range of construction equipment including excavators, bulldozers, skid steers, loaders, cranes, lifts, generators, compressors, and much more. Our inventory includes equipment from top manufacturers like Bobcat, John Deere, Cat, Genie, JLG, and many others."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does Lafayette have any physical locations for me to visit?",
          "answer": "Lafayette operates as an online platform, but we partner with local rental companies in your area. While we don't have physical locations, we work with established rental companies that do have local facilities for equipment pickup, delivery, and service."
        },
        {
          "question": "How many hours are included on my rental?",
          "answer": "Most equipment rentals include 8-10 hours of operation per day. Extended hours may be available for an additional fee. Be sure to check the specific terms for your rental equipment, as hours and rates can vary by equipment type and rental company."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Lafayette handle rental extensions?",
          "answer": "Rental extensions are typically available if the equipment isn't already booked by another customer. Contact us at least 24 hours before your scheduled return date to request an extension. Additional charges will apply based on the daily rate."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does Lafayette provide rental equipment insurance?",
          "answer": "Yes, we offer comprehensive damage protection and liability insurance options. Our insurance coverage helps protect you against accidental damage, theft, and third-party liability. Coverage options and rates vary by equipment type and rental duration."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I have to pay for delivery and pick up or can I haul the equipment myself?",
          "answer": "Delivery and pickup services are available for most equipment. Rates vary based on distance and equipment size. Some smaller equipment can be self-hauled if you have the proper vehicle and trailer. Contact us for specific delivery options and pricing for your location."
